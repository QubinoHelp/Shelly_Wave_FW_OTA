## The latest - last firmware updates for for Qubino devices that support Over-the-Air (OTA) updates.

Before using the newest OTA files, you should know that the older models canâ€™t be updated to the newest firmware. That is because the older models do not have the S2 secure inclusion. This kind of security needs to be hard-coded and this can only be done by the manufacturer.

To find out if your 3-Phase Smart Meter, Smart Meter and Smart Plug supports OTA, you must check the **Z-wave DSK QR code**. It can be found on the label on the side of the device. You can also find it in the device's packaging box. If it has a code, it can be updated. 


The **RGBW dimmer** do not need to be verified as it have the OTA available from the first release on.


### Below are some examples of the QR DSK codes:
