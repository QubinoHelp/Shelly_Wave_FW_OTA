# Firmware update definition files

This directory contains the Shelly Qubino Wave definition files for firmware Over The Air (OTA) updates.

# Attention.
Depending on the firmware revision, OTA updating can cause the parameters to be reset to their factory settings value (the device will not be excluded from the network). In this case the device will have the led showing red, green and blue colors for 1 seconds each and it will not react to user action for 1 minute. After that the device will switch to normal operating mode.
